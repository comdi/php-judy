1. INTRODUCTION
-----------------

php-judy is an extension by Nicolas Brousse for the Judy C library.

    http://github.com/orieg/php-judy

A Judy array is a complex but very fast associative array data structure for
storing and looking up values using integer or string keys. Unlike normal
arrays, Judy arrays may be sparse; that is, they may have large ranges of
unassigned indices.

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_array

Judy is a C library that implements a dynamic array.  Empty Judy arrays are
declared with null pointers.  A Judy array consumes memory only when
populated yet can grow to take advantage of all available memory.  Judy's key
benefits are:  scalability, performance, memory efficiency, and ease of use.
Judy arrays are designed to grow without tuning into the peta-element range,
scaling near O(log-base-256) -- 1 more RAM access at 256 X population.

Judy1  - maps an Index (word) to a bit
JudyL  - maps an Index (word) to a Value (word/pointer)
JudySL - maps an Index (null terminated string) to a Value
JudyHS - maps an Index (array-of-bytes) of Length to a Value
