1. INTRODUCTION
-----------------

php-judy is an exentsion by Nicolas Brousse for the Judy C library.

    http://github.com/orieg/php-judy

Judy is a C library that implements a dynamic array.  Empty Judy arrays are
declared with null pointers.  A Judy array consumes memory only when
populated yet can grow to take advantage of all available memory.  Judy's key
benefits are:  scalability, performance, memory efficiency, and ease of use.
Judy arrays are designed to grow without tuning into the peta-element range,
scaling near O(log-base-256) -- 1 more RAM access at 256 X population.
